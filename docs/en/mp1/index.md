- The "flesh" material now also behaves just like the "character" material by using the same particle effects and sounds.

## Changes - Part 2

- All graphic novel pages are now really disabled when using Parental Lock, the only viewable page is now the new one that was mentioned earlier. 
(This was done to bring Parental Lock in line with the text that says "all graphic novel screens are removed" when starting the game with Parental Lock on.)
- The dead mobster tied to the chair in "The Blood Veins of New York" now uses the "death" face texture correctly, like the other "custom death" animations.
- The AI-controlled Max who appears tied to the chair in the first nightmare level now uses the "death" face texture, because his eyes are normally open.
- "Angel of Death" and the two nightmare levels now use the "asgard" skybox instead of not using any skybox. This "asgard" skybox just consists of a simple plain cloudy sky.
- "Put Out My Flames With Gasoline" now uses the unused "skyscrapers_streetlevel" skybox. The restaurant is actually located in Manhattan, I saw this in the intro cutscene.
- Fixed the "dropped-by-dead-enemy Pump-Action Shotgun" projectile, now it correctly uses the rifle collision sound instead of the handgun one.
- Fixed the "painkiller" weapon's HUD text if you somehow manage to end up wielding it, now it uses it's own proper alpha texture which was left unused.
- Any thrown Grenades now leave a small mark on whatever they collide with, just like when using melee weapons.
- Changed the Colt Commando bullet model, now it uses the Sniper Rifle bullet model instead of the Beretta bullet model.
- Separated character and flesh bullet hit particle effects from generic bullet hit effects, so the game only disables those ones when using Parental Lock.
- All weapons now use one model for both far and near distances, which no longer causes the weapon animations to not display when the camera is far away.
- Fixed the Dual Berettas' reload sound playing three times when reloading the Dual Berettas, now only one reload sound plays on each gun.
- A shotgun shell now ejects from the gun after each shot when using the Jackhammer.
- Restored Michelle Payne's "alive" face texture, the game now only uses her "death" face texture when she performs any death animations.
- Improved weapon animation resetting, now weapons in both hands have their animations reset instead of only the right one and the animations are now reset instantly.
- Fixed Alfred Woden's glasses alpha texture, the missing glass piece of the glasses is now completely invisible instead of being semi-transparent.
- Fixed the "docks" skybox, now the buildings on the horizon don't look like they are "sunk" in the docks water and the entire skybox texture is repositioned.
- Removed the unrealistic "burst-firing" from the Ingram and Dual Ingrams, now they fire single shots on each press of the Shoot button.
- Removed the "combined" shooting sound of Dual Ingrams, now each gun plays it's own sound.
- Removed all "gangsta", "mobster" and "merc" variations of all weapons' shooting animations from all characters, they're way too "broken-looking" to be actually used in the game.
- Mercenaries no longer try to shoot at the player while descending down using ropes in some levels, their shots are never accurate and correctly timed.
- Decreased the collision capsule height for rats to be the same as their collision capsule's radius, so the player doesn't float above the rats when standing on them.
- Junkies and Project: Valhalla test subjects now shout whenever using any weapon, instead of only when using the Beretta.
- Removed all weapon animations from the Sniper Rifle, the animations are way too long to work properly and the gun's chamber pulls itself back automatically.
- Replaced the Sniper Rifle's shooting animation with a much more better-looking one that was meant for a cut "burst-fire MP5" weapon.
- Fixed the position of the Sniper Rifle's bullet shell creation, now it falls out of the chamber instead of falling out from the end of the gun's barrel.
- Sniper Rifle's bullet shell now falls out instantly after firing a shot, instead of taking way too long.
- Fixed the incorrect timing of the left hand Beretta's bullet projectile creation when using the Dual Berettas.
- B.B. now no longer uses the Desert Eagle shooting animation when using the Beretta.
- Rats can now reload and shoot all weapons properly, especially the Dual Berettas and Dual Ingrams.
- Added light camera shake effects to Sawed-Off Shotgun and M79, and heavy camera shake effects to Jackhammer and Sniper Rifle.
- Increased the look-at blend time to 0.25, now it matches the internal blend time used for character animations and Max's head turns more smoothly.
- Picking up an M79 ammo-box now gives you four M79 grenades and picking up a Sniper Rifle now gives you five bullets.
- Removed the chamber sound from the Sniper Rifle because it no longer moves.
- Sniper Rifle's shooting sound effect now slows down when the time slows down.
- Changed distance fogging values in "Fear that Gives Men Wings" to match the ones that were used in the older builds of the level.
- Increased the player's health multiplier in New York Minute difficulty level from 0.9 to 1.0 for literally balanced and normalized gameplay.
